This is basically a list of dependencies needed to compile TallNether. I made the project when I was still new to 
programming Java (or any compiled language) and had little knowledge of build automation. Unfortunately because of 
its reliance on numerous NMS versions converting it to a Maven project would be more hassle than it's worth.
